## The auto_failback option determines whether a resource will automatically fail back 
## to its "primary" node, or remain on whatever node is serving it until that node fails,
## or an administrator intervenes. 
## Typically, you want to set auto_failback on for an ActiveActive cluster, 
## and commonly to off for an ActivePassive cluster.
## NOTE: auto_failback does not have any effect on a Release 2 CRM-style cluster (one configured with crm on). For CRM-style clusters, this has been replaced with the default_resource_stickiness attribute in the CIB.
